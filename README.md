# Hey 👋 I'm Quentin

## About me

I am currently a master student at ENS Paris-Saclay (M2 [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)) and [ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/en) Paris (Engineering cycle). My academic journey and projects center around statistics and machine learning, with a particular focus on deep learning in recent years.

## Recent (public) Work



### Research projects

* [Moving Mahalanobis](https://github.com/QMoayedpour/QMoayedpour/blob/main/files/report_internship_2024.pdf) (Report in French): A method to perform Anomaly Detection on unimodel time series by leveraging a pre-trained model. Online setup enabling continuous inference without any model training.

* [Clinical Trial Duration](https://github.com/QMoayedpour/ClinicalDuration): An econometric project investigating factors prolonging clinical trials. Leveraged NLP techniques and multiple variables to extract features from clinical trial descriptions.

* [Modern Bert for Clinical Trial](https://github.com/QMoayedpour/ModernBert_ENSAE): An application and analysis of ModernBert for clinical trial named entity recognition

* [Online Stochastic Matching](https://github.com/QMoayedpour/OnlineMatchingStochastic): Report and comparison of different methods for online stochastic matching

* [LSTM For Portfolio Allocation](https://github.com/QMoayedpour/Advanced_ML_Ensae): Use of Recurrent-NN Architecture to handle constrained portfolio allocation.

### Implemented Paper and report

* [Detecting changes in slope with an L0 penalty](https://github.com/QMoayedpour/Change-Point-Detection-L1-Penalty?tab=readme-ov-file), Maidstone & Al. [2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.01672): Changepoint detection with l0 penalty by using dynamic programming

* [Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning](https://github.com/NailKhelifa/PrototypicalFewShots?tab=readme-ov-file), Snell & Al. [2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05175): A neural network designed to handle few shot learning by "learning to separate"

* [Mixture Model for Random Graphs](https://github.com/QMoayedpour/Mixture-Model-for-Random-Graphs), Daudin & Al. [2006](https://inria.hal.science/inria-00070186/document): A statistical model to perform clustering on Unoriented graphs.


### Private Work 🔒

* Video Models for deepfake detection: Work conducted @ Entrust to use video models and training strategy to perform deep fake detection with strong generalisation and fair results

* GAN Models for financial synthetic data: Work conducted with HSBC to study the potential of generated time series using GAN-models
